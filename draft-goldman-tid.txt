             The Time-Ordered ID and b32tid Binary Encoding
                        draft-goldman-tid-latest

Abstract

   Developed for use in a high-bandwidth distributed social networking
   context, the TID is essentially a highly-compact UUIDv6 variant that
   optimizes for a few specific properties (most notably being sortable
   both bytewise and lexically) and fits into the space-efficient int64
   type of languages that support it.  It uses a bespoke base-32
   encoding alphabet rather than the similar base32hex encoding, as the
   latter mandates a final padding character and is less URL-safe.

1.  Introduction

   The TID is essentially a UUIDv6 variant that optimizes for a few
   specific properties:

   1.  sortable both bytewise and lexically when encoded with a base32
       variant (also specified in this document);

   2.  collision-resistant up to a 1024 independent parallel
       timestamping services, with this set of 1024 broken up in 3
       contiguous namespace to support various use-cases described below

   3.  based on microseconds since unix epoch to simplify translation to
       other timestamp formats;

   4.  fits in an int64 and

   5.  works well across the type systems or most major compiled
       languages in use today for application-level development.

   Many minor choices, such as the choice of code points in the
   alternate base32 encoding and the signed nature of the timestamp
   bytespace are primarily informed by cross-language ergonomics.

   The 32 code points chosen to encode from binary, in order, are:

   value               1111111111222222222233
             01234567890123456789012345678901
   encoding  234567abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

   This differs from the canonical base32 encoding defined in [RFC4648]
   in two ways: firstly, the letters are lowercase, and secondly, the
   letters and numbers are inverted in the mapping sequence, such that
   bytewise ordering of binary TIDs and lexical sorting of base-encoded
   TIDs will always achieve the same ordering.

   value                1111111111222222222233
              01234567890123456789012345678901
   base32tid  234567abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   base32     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567

2.  Timestamp Component

   The form of timestamp used to generate a TID is the number
   microseconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00), i.e.
   with three more digits than an [RFC5102] dateTimeMilliseconds.  In
   cases where a timestamping service may be returning timestamps faster
   than 1000 times every millisecond, uniqueness should be favored over
   microsecond accuracy; i.e., the ID generator should return the
   current microsecond since epoch OR the last microsecond returned plus
   1, whichever is greater.

   Note that the range of times that fit in the int54 is actually
   purposefully limited to 2^53 by dropping the negative half of the
   range.  This is to avoid a quirk of the Java type system that
   converts 54-byte integers to floats.  The following tables shows the
   min, zero, and max values of the integer range of microseconds,
   expressed in the 11-codepoint base32tid encoding:

   s222-222-2222 1684-07-28T00:12:25.259008 min  i64
   2222-222-2222 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000 zero i64
   bzzz-zzz-zzzz 2255-06-05T23:47:34.740992 max  i64

3.  Node Identifier Component

   The node identifier, by analogy to the equivalent element in an
   [RFC9562] UUIDv6, is a spatially-unique identifier, but from much
   smaller space (10 bits, as opposed to UUIDv6's 48 bits).  It is
   divided into three contiguous ranges.  The first 32 values (0-31,
   i.e. "20" - "2z" base-encoded) are reserved for "best effort" TIDs.
   The bulk of the range, (32-991, i.e. "30" - "yz" base-encoded) is
   reserved for context-dependent use.  The remaining 32 entries
   (992-1023, i.e. "z0" - "zz" base-encoded) are reserved for globally
   unique TIDs.

   "Best effort" node identifiers can be generated without coordination
   but may collide.

   Context-dependent should be use in the context of a specific
   application where they can be derived stably from application
   context.  The application developer should take steps to ensure the
   that in any given time range, no node identifiers are in simultaneous
   use by two different actors.  No process is specified for
   coordinating leases of node identifiers to actors.

   Globally-unique node identifiers should only be used after being
   registered globally.  At time of writing, there is only one public
   TimeID service operating.

    +=========+================+============+===============+=========+
    | ClockID | URL            | public key | from          | to      |
    +=========+================+============+===============+=========+
    | z0      | http://ccn.bz/ | todo       | 2222-222-2222 | ongoing |
    |         | tid            |            |               |         |
    +---------+----------------+------------+---------------+---------+

                                  Table 1

4.  Base-Encoded String Expression

   The TimeID concatenates the timestamp and the node identifier.  The
   string format is 11 code points of timestamp and 2 code points of
   node identifier, displayed for readability with - segment dividers
   after the 4th, 7th, and 11th code points:

   TTTT-TTT-TTTT-CC

   Since each code point in base32-encoding represents 5 bits, we need
   to sign-extend the 54 bits of the time stamp to 55 bits to convert to
   11 char of b32.

   We can take the timestamp 2024-07-19T09:40:46.480310 as an example to
   show the process.  This is 1721382046481 in seconds since Unix epoch.
   On a node with identifer 01, this base-encodes to:

   3kxn-lhr-3gxq-23
    | |   |    |  |
    | |   |    |  NodeID 0-1023
    | |   |    microsecond
    | |   second
    | 10 hours (9.54 hours)
    year (1.115 years)

   When using TimeIDs in string form, "prefixes" can be used to mask
   ranges, i.e.

   +==========================+==========================+=============+
   |start                     |end                       |tid          |

5.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

6.  Security Considerations

   This minimal format makes very few guarantees and is built
   specifically for distributed systems without assuming coordinated
   time-keeping.  The security implications of application-specific
   coordination of node identifiers are left as an exercise for the
   reader.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Currently, the registry for global TID services is maintained in a
   git repository maintained by the authors at github dot com.  In the
   unlikely event that this this specification should become normative,
   a more formal registry governed according to IANA best current
   practice would be justified.

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   For clarity, we've cross-computed a UUIDv6 for the test vector used
   above, as well as computed a TID for the test vector given for UUIDv6
   in [RFC9562], i.e. the 60-bit timestamp: 0x1EC9414C232AB00
   (138648505420000000), i.e. Tuesday, February 22, 2022 2:22:22.000000
   PM GMT-05:00.
